# UFOs
## Overview of Project
As a data journalist with the freedom to write about topics she wants to, Dana jumped on the opportunity to write about two things she loves; her hometown of McMinnvillle, Oregon and UFOs; a topic she has been interested in since childhood. McMinnville is known for its UFO sightings and even hosting an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts, so combining the two loves of hers will give Dana the opportunity to do some data analysis and work on her javascript and html skills.
 
Having been given a javascript containing data such as countries, states, and type of UFO sightings; Dana has posted her article online, while at the same time creating a table that shows UFO sightings based on date all in an html page. Dana would now like to provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings in her table by adding filters for city, state, country and UFO shape that will then also post information on the duration of the sighting and any comments associated.
